# Array-sort
School project

A School project where we had to create an array containing 130 random even numbers. we then had to sort the array.
we had to print out the unsorted and sorted array formatted so there is only 10 numbers per line.
we also had to print out the minimum and maximum number, the standard deviation and the mean.
